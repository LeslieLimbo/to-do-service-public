# Tutorial: Change a task name

In this tutorial, you will learn how to change the name of an existing task.

Expect this tutorial to take about 15 minutes to complete.

## Before you start

Make sure you've completed the [Before you start a tutorial] (before-you-start-a tutorial) topic on the development
system you'll use for the tutorial.

##Change a task name

You will need to use the 'PUT' command to perform a request from the service to change a given task to 
a new name ['task'](../api/task/title).

For the purpost of this tutorial title instead of name will be used in the "Put" request.

### To change a task name (title)

1. Confirm your local service is running. If it is not running, start it by using this command:

'''shek
cd <your-github-workspace>/to-do-service/api
json-srever -w to-do-db-source.json
'''

1. Open the Postman app on your desktop.
Create a new request with these values:
 * **METHOD**: PUT
* ** URL**: '{{base_url}}/tasks?title=,replae this text with full title>'

**Example:**

'htto://localhost:3000/tasks?title=Book conert tickets'

**Note:** You need to match the case of the title.

1. In the Postman app, select **Send** to make the request.
2. Watch for the respnse body, which shuold look something like the following:

  '''js
[
 {
     "user_id: 1,
     "title": "Book concert tickets",
     "title": "Get concert tickets",
     "description": "Get tickets for Billy Joel concert",
     "due_date": "2024-04-02T15:00",
     "warning": "-30",
     "id": "2"
 }
]

Nothing will be reurned if no titles are found matching the information that you entered.

This Postman tutorial can also be done in other programming languages. Use the data from 
the initial request and follow the syntax of the selected programming languae to execute your API call.
